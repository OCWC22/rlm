## ❓ Question

What is the MAX-HEAPIFY algorithm? Give me the exact pseudocode from page 234 or 235. Include the page number.

## 💡 Answer

FOUND on page 234 [📄 View Page 234](file:///Users/chen/Projects/rlm/examples/textbook-qa/books/IntroductiontoAlgorithmsFourthEdition.pdf#page=234):
============================================================
Figure 6.2 The action of MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 2), where A.heap-size = 10. The node that
potentially violates the max-heap property is shown in blue. (a) The initial conﬁguration, with
A[2] at node i = 2 violating the max-heap property since it is not larger than both children. The
max-heap property is restored for node 2 in (b) by exchanging A[2] with A[4], which destroys the
max-heap property for node 4. The recursive call MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 4) now has i = 4. After
A[4] and A[9] are swapped, as shown in (c), node 4 is ﬁxed up, and the recursive call MAX-
HEAPIFY(A, 9) yields no further change to the data structure.
MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i)
  1l = LEFT(i)
  2r = RIGHT(i)
  3if l ≤ A.heap-size and A[l] > A[i]

largest = l
  5else largest = i
  6if r ≤ A.heap-size and A[r] > A[largest]
  7
largest = r
