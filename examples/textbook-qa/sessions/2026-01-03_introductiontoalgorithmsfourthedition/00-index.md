## 🔑 All Key Concepts

- Dynamic Programming, Like The Divide-And-Conquer Method, Solves Problems By Combining The Solutions To Subproblems. ('Programming' In This Context Refers To A Tabular Method, Not To Writing Computer Code.) As We Saw In Chapters 2 And 4, Divide-And-Conquer Algorithms Partition The Problem Into Disjoint Subproblems, Solve The Subproblems Recursively, And Then Combine Their Solutions To Solve The Original Problem. In Contrast, Dynamic Programming Applies When The Subproblems Overlap—That Is, When Subproblems Share Subsubproblems. In This Context, A Divide-And-Conquer Algorithm Does More Work Than Necessary, Repeatedly Solving The Common Subsubproblems. A Dynamic-Programming Algorithm Solves Each Subsubproblem Just Once And Then Saves Its Answer In A Table, Thereby Avoiding The Work Of Recomputing The Answer Every Time It Solves Each Subsubproblem.
- A Problem Exhibits Optimal Substructure If An Optimal Solution To The Problem Contains Within It Optimal Solutions To Subproblems.
- When A Recursive Algorithm Revisits The Same Problem Repeatedly, We Say That The Optimization Problem Has Overlapping Subproblems.
- The Problem Is To Determine The Maximum Revenue Rₙ Obtainable By Cutting Up The Rod And Selling The Pieces.
