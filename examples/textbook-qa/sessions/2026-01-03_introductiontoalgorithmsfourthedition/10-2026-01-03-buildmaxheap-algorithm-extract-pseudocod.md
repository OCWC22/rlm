## ❓ Question

What is the BUILD-MAX-HEAP algorithm? Extract the pseudocode from pages 236-237 VERBATIM. Include page links.

---

## 💡 Answer

Extract the BUILD-MAX-HEAP pseudocode from this text.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Copy the pseudocode VERBATIM - exactly as written, character for character
2. Include line numbers
3. Also extract the loop invariant statement (the formal one starting with "At the start of each iteration...")
4. Copy EXACTLY - do not paraphrase or reformat

manipulation on a min-heap. How does the running time of MIN-
HEAPIFY compare with that of MAX-HEAPIFY?
6.2-4
What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i) when the element
A[i] is larger than its children?
6.2-5
What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i) for i > A.heap-
size/2?
6.2-6
The code for MAX-HEAPIFY is quite efﬁcient in terms of constant
factors, except possibly for the recursive call in line 10, for which some
compilers might produce inefﬁcient code. Write an efﬁcient MAX-
HEAPIFY that uses an iterative control construct (a loop) instead of
recursion.
6.2-7
Show that the worst-case running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a heap
of size n is Ω(lg n). (Hint: For a heap with n nodes, give node values that
cause MAX-HEAPIFY to be called recursively at every node on a
simple path from the root down to a leaf.)
6.3      Building a heap
The procedure BUILD-MAX-HEAP converts an array A[1 : n] into a
max-heap by calling MAX-HEAPIFY in a bottom-up manner. Exercise
6.1-8 says that the elements in the subarray A[⌊n/2⌋ + 1 : n] are all leaves
of the tree, and so each is a 1-element heap to begin with. BUILD-
MAX-HEAP goes through the remaining nodes of the tree and runs
MAX-HEAPIFY on each one. Figure 6.3 shows an example of the
action of BUILD-MAX-HEAP.

MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i)
To show why BUILD-MAX-HEAP works correctly, we use the
following loop invariant:
At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2–3, each
node i + 1, i + 2, … , n is the root of a max-heap.
We need to show that this invariant is true prior to the ﬁrst loop
iteration, that each iteration of the loop maintains the invariant, that
the loop terminates, and that the invariant provides a useful property to
show correctness when the loop terminates.
Initialization: Prior to the ﬁrst iteration of the loop, i = ⌊n/2⌋. Each node
⌊n/2⌋ + 1, ⌊n/2⌋ + 2, … , n is a leaf and is thus the root of a trivial max-
heap.
Maintenance: To see that each iteration maintains the loop invariant,
observe that the children of node i are numbered higher than i. By the
loop invariant, therefore, they are both roots of max-heaps. This is
precisely the condition required for the call MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i) to
make node i a max-heap root. Moreover, the MAX-HEAPIFY call
preserves the property that nodes i + 1, i + 2, … , n are all roots of
max-heaps. Decrementing i in the for loop update reestablishes the
loop invariant for the next iteration.
