## 💡 Answer

## Answer

A red-black tree is defined as "a binary search tree with one extra bit of storage per node: its color, which can be either RED or BLACK" (Page 442). The fundamental characteristic is that "by constraining the node colors on any simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no such path is more than twice as long as any other, so that the tree is approximately balanced" (Page 442).

Formally, "a red-black tree must satisfy the following five properties," called the red-black properties (Page 442):

1. "Every node is either red or black."
2. "The root is black."
3. "Every leaf (NIL) is black."
4. "If a node is red, then both its children are black."
5. "For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes."

The textbook states conclusively: "A binary search tree that meets the red-black properties is a red-black tree" (Page 442).

An important property proven in Lemma 13.1 is that "a red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2 lg(n + 1)" (Page 443), which guarantees O(lg n) time complexity for basic operations.

## Synthesis Notes

This answer is composed entirely of direct quotes and information from the textbook. The five properties are listed exactly as they appear in the source material. The height bound (Lemma 13.1) is included as it's a fundamental property that distinguishes red-black trees from ordinary binary search trees. No synthesis or interpretation was needed - the textbook provides a clear, self-contained definition.
