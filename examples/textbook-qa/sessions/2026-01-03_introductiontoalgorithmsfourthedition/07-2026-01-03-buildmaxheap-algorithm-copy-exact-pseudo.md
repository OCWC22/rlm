## 💡 Answer

## 📖 Verbatim from Textbook

# BUILD-MAX-HEAP EXTRACTION

## Page Number
The BUILD-MAX-HEAP pseudocode appears on **PAGE 235** (based on the context and typical textbook structure, though the actual pseudocode page is not fully shown in the provided text).

## Information from Provided Text

### From PAGE 232:
**Key Description:**
"The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max-heap from an unordered input array."

### Related Helper Function - MAX-HEAPIFY

**From PAGE 231:**
"The MAX-HEAPIFY procedure, which runs in O(lg n) time, is the key to maintaining the max-heap property."

**From PAGE 233-234:**
The procedure MAX-HEAPIFY maintains the max-heap property. Its inputs are an array A with the heap-size attribute and an index i into the array. When it is called, MAX-HEAPIFY assumes that the binary trees rooted at LEFT(i) and RIGHT(i) are max-heaps, but that A[i] might be smaller than its children, thus violating the max-heap property. MAX-HEAPIFY lets the value at A[i] "float down" in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index i obeys the max-heap property.

## Note:
**The actual BUILD-MAX-HEAP pseudocode with line numbers and exact formatting is NOT included in the provided text section.** The text mentions BUILD-MAX-HEAP and describes its purpose and running time, but the actual algorithm pseudocode appears to be on a subsequent page (likely page 235 or later) that was not included in the extract provided.

To provide the complete verbatim pseudocode with line numbers as requested, I would need the page that actually contains the BUILD-MAX-HEAP algorithm itself.

## 🧠 Simple Explanation

**In plain English:** BUILD-MAX-HEAP converts an unsorted array into a max-heap by working backwards from the middle of the array, calling MAX-HEAPIFY on each node to ensure the heap property is maintained.

**Key points:**
1. Starts at the last non-leaf node (at index ⌊n/2⌋)
2. Works backwards to the root, calling MAX-HEAPIFY on each node
3. Running time is O(n), which is surprisingly efficient
4. After BUILD-MAX-HEAP completes, the array satisfies the max-heap property

**Why start at ⌊n/2⌋?** Nodes after this index are all leaves (no children), so they already satisfy the heap property trivially.
