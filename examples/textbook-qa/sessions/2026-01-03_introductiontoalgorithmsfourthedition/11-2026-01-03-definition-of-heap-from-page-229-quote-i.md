## ❓ Question

What is the definition of a heap from page 229? Quote it verbatim with the page number.

---

## 💡 Answer

Based on the page content provided, there is a descriptive statement but no formal boxed definition. The closest definitional text is:

"The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1."

However, this sentence appears to be cut off and incomplete (it ends mid-sentence with "which is ﬁlled"). The page does not contain a complete formal definition of the heap property or max-heap property. The text is introductory and describes what a heap data structure is in terms of its representation, but the formal definition (likely including the heap property) appears to continue on the next page.

NO COMPLETE FORMAL DEFINITION FOUND on this page.
